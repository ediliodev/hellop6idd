For anyone trying out devise with MRI 2.5.0-preview1, it looks like devise has a fix for this on the master branch: 1009096

Add the following to gems.rb (or Gemfile):

# gem 'devise',               '~> 4.3.0'
gem 'devise', git: 'https://github.com/plataformatec/devise' #, ref: '88e9a85'

The ref is optional but can be used in case master is failing.

Also, here is a related (closed) issue on the Ruby issue tracker: https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13939

>>OK LO DE ARRIBA ME RESOLVIO CUANDO USO RAILS 5.1.6 (VIENE 5.0.6) DEVISE 4 FIXED.
